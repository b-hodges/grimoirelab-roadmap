  * Why: Can indicate the current stage of development that the project is in (i.e. a project ramping up for a new release may have more DRAFT issues than NEW)
* Backlog (Open PRs and Issues)
  * What: Listing of all open issues and pull requests
  * Why: Shows that a community is active by having a lot of issues and pull requests, can also show inactivity of community managers if too many issues or pull requests aren't being resolved
