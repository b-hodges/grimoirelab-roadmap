  * What (Leaving): Counts developers who made their last commit 6 months ago.
  * Why: Shows how many new developers are contributing to the project versus developers who have gone inactive in the project.
* Issue Submitters:
  * What: List of everyone who has opened an issue to a project, along with number of issues, number of repositories, and average length their issues remain open.

* Pull Request By Organization:
  * What: Count of pull request by developers associated with a particular organization.
  * Why: Shows ownership and support of the project by organizations.
* 80% Open Time (days):
  * What: Amount of time it takes for 80% of pull requests to be closed from a specific month/day.
  * Why: Shows how responsive project managers are with accepting/denying pull requests.
* Identities
  * What: Track the same user across multiple profiles
  * Why: Prevents over-counting individual developers and allows more accurate identification of important developers
* Top Repositories
  * What: Measures activity (commits, authors, lines of code, etc.) of multiple scanned respositories
  * Why: Provides a realtive view of repositories within a project to see where activity is concentrated
* Assignee Organizations

* Gerrit: Changeset Status

  * Why: Can indicate the current stage of development that the project is in (i.e. a project ramping up for a new release may have more DRAFT issues than NEW)
* Backlog (Open PRs and Issues)
  * What: Listing of all open issues and pull requests
  * Why: Shows that a community is active by having a lot of issues and pull requests, can also show inactivity of community managers if too many issues or pull requests aren't being resolved.
* Pull Request Submitters
  * What: Count of individual pull request submitters by date
  * Why: Shows activity level of the community for making updates/fixes
* Top Repositories
