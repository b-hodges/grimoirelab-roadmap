# GrimoireLab Metrics

A non-comprehensive set of metrics measured by GrimoireLab

* Top Authors:
  * What: Measures how many commits they've made, lines added/removed in their commits, how many projects they work on
  * Why: Shows who's making the most contributions/how active they are in the community. Gives a good idea of who people should talk to for issues or add to the core team
  * ![Top Authors](images/top-authors.png)
* Attracted/Leaving Developers:
  * What (Attracted): Counts new developers making commits to the project by month
  * What (Leaving): Counts developers who made their last commit 6 months ago
  * Why: Shows how many new developers are contributing to the project versus developers who have gone inactive in the project
  * ![Attracted/Leaving Developers](images/attracted-inactive.png)
* Issue Submitters:
  * What: List of everyone who has opened an issue to a project, along with number of issues, number of repositories, and average length their issues remain open.
  * Why: Shows the variety of submitters, how active they are, and how quickly their issues are resolved. Indicates the variety of perspectives and opinions contributing to the project
  * ![Issue Submitters](images/issue-submitters.png)
* Pull Request By Organization:
  * What: Count of pull request by developers associated with a particular organization
  * Why: Shows ownership and support of the project by organizations.
  * ![Pull Requests by Organization](images/pull-req-org.png)
* 80% Open Time (days):
  * What: Amount of time it takes for 80% of pull requests to be closed from a specific month/day
  * Why: Shows how responsive project managers are with accepting/denying pull requests
  * ![80% Open Time](images/80-percent-open-time.png)
* Identities
  * What: Track the same user across multiple profiles
  * Why: Prevents over-counting individual developers and allows more accurate identification of important developers

```
* Top Repositories
  * What: Measures activity (commits, authors, lines of code, etc.) of multiple scanned repositories
  * Why: Provides a relative view of repositories within a project to see where activity is concentrated
  * ![Top Repositories](images/top-repos.png)
* Assignee Organizations
  * What: Counts the issues assigned to individual organizations
  * Why: Can indicate which organizations are valued by the community itself
  * ![Assignee Organizations](images/assignee-orgs.png)
* Mailing Lists: Emails
  * What: Counts the emails send on mailing lists associated with the project
  * Why: Indicates how responsive the mailing lists are via volume of traffic
  * ![Mailing Lists: Emails](images/mailing-lists.png)
* Gerrit: Changeset Status
  * What: Counts the changesets of each status
  * Why: Can indicate the current stage of development that the project is in (i.e. a project ramping up for a new release may have more DRAFT issues than NEW)
  * ![Gerrit: Changeset Status](images/gerrit-status.png)
* Backlog (Open PRs and Issues)
  * What: Listing of all open issues and pull requests
  * Why: Shows that a community is active by having a lot of issues and pull requests, can also show inactivity of community managers if too many issues or pull requests aren't being resolved
  * ![Backlog](images/backlog.png)
* Pull Request Submitters
  * What: Count of individual pull request submitters by date
  * Why: Shows activity level of the community for making updates/fixes
  * ![Pull Request Submitters](images/pull-request-submitters.png)
* Pull Request Status
  * What: Graphic showing amount of open and closed pull requests
  * Why: Shows quickly how many open requests are in contrast to closed requests. This information can be used to see if a community is letting open requests pile up
  * ![Pull Request Status](images/pull-status.png)
 * Commits By Timezone
  * What: Graphical representation of how many commits have originated from each timezone
  * Why: Shows what timezones have users making commits to the project which can be used to track the spread of project contributers
  * ![Commits By Timezone](images/commits-timezone.png)
